	<h1 class="title">Overview</h1>
	<h2 class="subtitle">What is it?</h2>
	<p class="one">
		It’s the retro recreation we’ve all been waiting for, VW’s <span>take on a latter day Type 2</span>, a nod to a funkier
		electric future and a family wagon you might actually want to drive. It’s the ID. Buzz.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 class="subtitle">What’s the score then? Full camper van? Seven seats? The promise of regular breakdowns?</h2>
	<p class="two">
		No ‘California’ camper van version just yet, in fact word on the street is that’s been pushed to the end of this
		decade to allow demand to warm up a bit. Three versions are now available: a five-seat ID. Buzz, an ID. Buzz Cargo
		commercial van with up to three seats across the front and a cavern behind, and a stretch Buzz seven-seat (the
		green one in the gallery above). Spoiler alert – <span>the seven-seater is categorically the one you want…</span> more on that
		in a bit.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2 class="subtitle">So it’s an MPV in a fancy outfit?</h2>
	<p class="three">
		That’s about the size of it. But compared to any other family car out there, this is going to look and feel very
		different. It makes the humble MPV desirable, for a start. But that is what this is: an MPV. There are a few neat
		options though, including a load divider to vertically split the boot and provide a raised floor that lines up
		with the folded rear seats. A mattress makes this a semi-Cali, plus there’s a whole host of third-party companies
		waiting to sell you all sorts of accessories – even a full camper conversion if you can’t wait for the official
		one.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="four">
		The basics are as follows. It uses the same MEB platform as the ID.3, ID.4 and ID.5, but that’s scaleable, so here
		it’s been lengthened, gaining a 2,988mm wheelbase that’s as long as the current Caravelle’s. There are sliding
		doors both sides. The powertrain has recently been upgraded so the RWD five-seat version gets a power bump from
		204bhp to 282bhp, slashing the 0-60mph time from 10.2 to 7.6 seconds. And you feel it. There’s a clarity to the
		throttle response and a surge off the line that does a miraculous job of masking the 2.7-tonne kerbweight.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="five">
		There’s also a battery bump from 77kWh to 79kWh in the five-seater, extending the range to a claimed 283 miles on
		the WLTP test – think more like 170 if you’re loaded and checking out the 99mph top speed, but in reality probably
		around 200-230 miles. Unless it’s winter, when you’re likely back at the lower figure.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="six">
		Don’t go thinking it’ll be a perfect family ski-tripper. You’ll be visiting every aire in France. And besides,
		there’ll be no snow when you get there anyway. A 5-80 per cent charge takes 35 minutes (assuming you can find a
		170kW charger). However the new, stretched seven-seat version does improve matters. More wheelbase means a bigger
		86kWh battery and up to 291 miles of range.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="seven">
		If going fast in something with the aerodynamic profile of a hay bale is your thing, there’s even a GTX version.
		Available exclusively in 4WD, with a motor on each axle for a total of 335bhp and 413lb ft of torque. The 0-62mph
		drops to 6.1 seconds, the price leaps up to almost £70k, but you do get a towing capacity of 1,800kg versus
		1,000kg for the standard Buzz.
